Odin recipes project

This is the Foundations Project called "recipes" from Odin. When this is complete, I hope to have demonstrated the following knowledge:

- HTML boilerplate coding
- Adding simple HTML elements such as paragraphs, links and images
- Use Git commit properly following conventions set out by Odin Project
