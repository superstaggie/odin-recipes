                        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Whisky cream sauce</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 tbsp cracked black pepper</li>
                        <li>50g butter</li>

                        <li>2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped</li>
                        <li>120ml Scotch whisky</li>

                        <li>200ml double cream</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the haggis according to the packet instructions.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile make the tatties. Cook the potatoes in a saucepan of salted boiling water for about 12-15 minutes until the chunks are soft and tender. Drain in a colander and allow to cool for 5 minutes to get a little fluffy on the outside. Mash the potatoes using a ricer. Heat the milk and cream in a saucepan until just simmering, then add to the mash with the butter. Season and mix until you have a smooth, creamy mash.</li>
                    <li>To make the neeps, cook the swede in a saucepan of salted boiling water for about 12-15 minutes until the chunks are soft and tender. Drain in a colander. Add the butter and mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>To make the sauce, toast the pepper in a dry frying pan and set aside. Melt the butter and oil in the pan and add the shallots. Fry until fragrant and soft, but not browned. Pour in the whisky, turn up the heat and simmer for a second. Add the beef stock, then the cream. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for around 10 minutes or until reduced by about half. Stir in the cracked pepper.</li>
                    <li>Serve the haggis, neeps and tatties with the whisky sauce on the side.</li>
