            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Cullen Skink is a traditional Scottish soup made by simmering smoked haddock with cream, potatoes and onions. It originated from the town of Cullen, Moray (North East Scotland).</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1 medium onion</li>
                    <li>400g medium potatoes (about 2), peeled and cut into 1cm cubes</li>
                    <li>250g smoked haddock (ideally finnan haddie)</li>
                    <li>250ml whole milk</li>
                    <li>1/2 small bunch parsley or chives, finely chopped</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, then add the onion and fry for 5-8 mins until translucent but not browned. Add the potatoes and 300ml water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer for 10-15 mins.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, put the haddock in another pan and cover with the the milk. Cook gently for 5 mins, or until just tender. Remove the haddock from the milk with a slotted spoon (reserving the milk), transfer to a plate and leave to cool slightly. When cool enough to touch, flake into large pieces, removing any bones.</li>
                    <li>Put the reserved milk and flaked haddock in the pan with the potato mixture and cook for another 5 mins. Season and sprinkle over the parsley to serve.</li>
                </ol>
